# ♻️ Waste Classification Dashboard using Deep Learning

## 🌍 Project Overview
This project presents an AI-powered **Waste Classification System** that classifies everyday waste items into **10 categories** to promote sustainable waste management and recycling.  
It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)** to identify the type of waste from uploaded images — such as plastic, glass, paper, or batteries — directly through a simple web interface.

The model is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, allowing users to upload any waste image and receive instant classification results.
